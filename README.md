# WordStream a high performance reading app

WordStream displays text to be read in a consistent place on the screen, so your eyes don't have to move.

This project was written to experiment with various frame rates and formats to try to provide improved reading experiences.

WordStream allows users to select intervals (ms) , and length of text to be displayed in each frame, like a tachistoscope.
