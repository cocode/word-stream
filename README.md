# WordStream a high performance reading app

This project is to experiment with various project rates and formats to try to provide improved reading experiences.

WordStream displays text to be read in a consistent place on the screen, so your eyes don't have to move.

WordStream allows users to select intervals (ms) , and length of text to be displayed in each frame, like a tachistoscope.
